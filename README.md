- 👋 Hi, My name is Rick Baker
- 👀 I’m interested in personalised video development. In 1991 I invented system which allowed a computer with help of motion tracking cameras etc for the first time to "automatically" produce 
truly personalised coaching video, similar to having face to face communications with an expert person today.
- 🌱 In 2006 I improved upon my earlier invention and now have further issued patent again for the production of personalised video in USA, UK & Canada using this time MEMs motion sensors. 
- 💞️ With latest invention programmers can make  --- you may have seen before from major developers "computer personalised trainer" which shows a person their movement on a screen againsts 
a stored experts movement or objects movement and generates when needed helpful audio instructional comments. System does this all automatically. System offers advancement for AI, IMU take up etc. 
- I have been acknowledged as the owner of the above technology by patents offices not others whom have just put out my technology and I now want to develop my latest system with the 
general programming community. There is many applications it can be used for. System is too important to be just shown, gain public attention and then developer abandons 
improvements, public is annoyed they purchased eauipment to receive the audio-visual presentation which cannot now be used.
- I’m looking for collaboration on developing applications using my patented system, which can be viewed here https://mycoachbuddy.com/technical-information/
